First, click on the Windows key and open the Anaconda Prompt. In that, type conda activate and press Enter to activate the environment.

Then, use the cd command to go to the folder where your Flask project is saved. For example: cd path\to\your\project.

Once you're inside the project folder, type python app.py and press Enter.

This will start the Flask server, and you'll see a link like http://127.0.0.1:5000. Open that link in your browser.

The web application will open, and you'll see options like Register, Login, and Image Upload.

Right now, we are at the image upload stage of the project
